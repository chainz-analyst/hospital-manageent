Hospital Data SQL Analysis

ðŸ“Œ Summary

This project focuses on analyzing hospital operational data using SQL to uncover actionable business insights. The dataset includes information on patients, appointments, treatments, and billing records.

The analysis covers:

Most Frequent Treatments Performed â€“ to identify high-demand medical services.

Treatments Generating the Highest Revenue â€“ to optimize profitability and pricing.

Revenue vs Number of Appointments Per Branch â€“ for branch performance comparison.

Appointment Payment and Completion Patterns â€“ to improve financial tracking.


Through the use of CTEs, aggregations, filtering, and multi-table JOINs, I was able to transform raw hospital data into clear insights that can guide decision-making and resource allocation in a healthcare setting.
